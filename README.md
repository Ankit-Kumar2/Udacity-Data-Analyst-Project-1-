Trying to analyze the factors that impact a patient going to the hospital 

The factors which I analyzed - 

1. Does age have an impact on the percentage of patients having a No No-show status?
2. Days to Appointment (Appointment Day - Scheduled Day) impact on number of patients with a No No-show status. 
   If days to appointment are high do the patients don't go for the appointment?
3. Does having enrolled in Brasilian welfare program have an impact on the percentage of patients having a No No-Show status (Mean and chi square test)
4. Do patients with hypertension tend to have more No No-show status than the patients with no Hypertension?
5. Are having hypertension and going for an appointment related? (Mean and Chi Square test)
